Hundreds of affordable housing pipeline projects were published by Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) and the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII). The projects listed are in the process of development--or are anticipated to be developed--in partnership with non-profit or for-profit developers and financed through city funding agreements, ground leases, disposition and participation agreements and conduit bond financing. The Affordable Housing Pipeline also includes housing units produced by private developers through the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program. \n\nIn this project, I will try to find a category of optimal affordable housing projects with better living facilities. This report will be targeted to individuals who want to have their own home but can not afford commodity housing in San Francisco. \n\nSince there are over hundreds of proiects in San Francisco, which one will be the right one. It is widely believed that a mature residential areas should be equipped with a range of living facilities, such as restaurants/gyms/markets/hospitals etc... So I am going to leverage the Foursquare location data to compare each project to provide reliable suggestions for individuals who need a place to live.\n\nData science powers we learnt these several weeks will be used to generate a few most promissing projects based on this criteria. I will cluster all the affordable housing programs into several catergories, advantages of each category will then be clearly expressed to help individuals make their first-step decisions.",

Except Housing Price, living facilities is one of the most important factors that influence the finally decision.\n\nAs the the business problem defined, we should download the data and explore it.  \n1) My raw data (**basic data about 'affordable housing programs'**) almost has all the information I need for the analysis, such as **'project_name /street_name /planning_address /planning_neighborhood /housing_tenure /longitude /latitude'**, especially the location information, which indeed do me a great favour. I will firstly pre-processed the data, as the suggestion is for individuals who want to buy a house, so **'housing_tenure' should be 'Ownership'**.  \n\n2) Venues data (**number of existing facilities and their type and location** in every affordable housing project) will be obtained through **Foursquare API**.
